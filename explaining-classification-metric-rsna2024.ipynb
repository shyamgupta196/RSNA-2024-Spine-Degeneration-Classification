The function checks if any of the predefined conditions (**'spinal'**, **'foraminal'**, **'subarticular'**) are present in the **full_location** string. If found, it returns the condition.

It takes four arguments: two pandas DataFrames **solution** and **submission**, a string **row_id_column_name**, and a float **any_severe_scalar**. The function calculates the sample weighted log loss for each medical condition, derives a new '**any_severe**' label, calculates the sample weighted log loss for the new '**any_severe**' label, and returns the average of all of the label group log losses as the final score. This score is normalized for the number of columns in each group to mitigate the impact of '**spinal stenosis**' having only half as many columns as the other two conditions.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"64a3e668","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"94061839-1c1d-4fcb-8883-455841dbd90e","_uuid":"00f80a3e-db72-4156-b013-c1fd19922995","collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-25T05:28:51.69739Z","iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-25T05:28:51.696692Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-25T05:28:54.326829Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-25T05:28:54.325603Z"},"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"papermill":{"duration":2.637731,"end_time":"2024-05-25T05:28:54.329686","exception":false,"start_time":"2024-05-25T05:28:51.691955","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import pandas.api.types\n","import sklearn.metrics\n","\n","\n","class ParticipantVisibleError(Exception):\n","    \n","    pass\n","\n","\n","def get_condition(full_location: str) -> str:\n","    # Given an input like spinal_canal_stenosis_l1_l2 extracts 'spinal'\n","    for injury_condition in ['spinal', 'foraminal', 'subarticular']:\n","        if injury_condition in full_location:\n","            return injury_condition\n","    raise ValueError(f'condition not found in {full_location}')\n","\n","\n","def score(\n","        solution: pd.DataFrame,\n","        submission: pd.DataFrame,\n","        row_id_column_name: str,\n","        any_severe_scalar: float\n","    ) -> float:\n","    '''\n","    Pseudocode:\n","    1.
